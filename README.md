# Minesweeper in Elm

This was an experiment in developing games with Elm.

Elm is a pure functional language that compiles to Javascript. I really liked
the language and the proposed architecture for applications. The fact that
everything is completely immutable combined with a good type system makes it
very easy and rewarding to write quality code.

The version of Elm at the time of this writing is 0.15.1. Even though some
parts of the language environment are very well developed, there is still major work to
be done in order for Elm to be "easy" to work with. It's not uncommon to find
broken documentation links, outdated documentation, out of date examples, etc.
The elm platform tools are very embrionary, lacking documentation and
sometimes basic functionality.

I see no perspective of a new release, even though the current version was
released months ago. Development seems rather active on the compiler, which
makes me thing they just don't have a good release strategy. There are lots of
pull requests needing attention all over the elm-lang organization. There are
also lots of discussions without conclusion on the mailing list.

Overall it seems like a very promising language that I definitely want to get
back to in the future. I just think it needs a strong company backing it up or a
stronger community.

I'm kind of sad to have to move on. Elm is awesome.
